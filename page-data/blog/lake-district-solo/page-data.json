He'd driven up to Egypt from South Africa a while back, different side of the continent, but we had a lot in common. It was great to have an open chat about Pakistan and the common perceptions of the west, we chatted about the sad passing of Ali Sadpara on K2.

Why sleep outside on your own when you could be safely tucked up in a comfortable bed surrounded by your family. The feeling of apprehension had quite an impact, but it was a familiar feeling. The year before I travelled through West & Central Africa was punctuated by the same apprehension and self doubt. It permeated into so much of my consciousness that my dreams were controlled by it. That trip turned out to be one of the best things I ever did. If this feeling was familiar then hopefully that was a good indicator of what was to come.
