One key difference between recruitment pipelines was that some companies were recruiting for a specific role, whilst others would direct you to a role based on your skills. I applied for one where there was a good values fit but my technical background just didn't match the technology, this was certainly a more mutual rejection.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Throughout the process my only real horror story was a company who attempted to replicate an in person day at the office over video calls.
